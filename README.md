# Hackathon: Junction 2021

## Supercell x Finnish Refugee Council

Almost all young people 15-29-year-olds play games, and majority of them have experienced or witnessed some hate speech, discrimination or harassment while playing games. At the same time games have a huge potential for increasing empathy as games trigger emotions. Join us to develop technical solutions that help to reduce hate and increase empathy in games and especially game chats.
